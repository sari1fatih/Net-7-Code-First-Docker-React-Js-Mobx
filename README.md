Requirements:

Backend Development:
 Develop a backend API using .NET Core, a lightweight and efficient framework for building web
applications.
 Implement an endpoint to retrieve property listings based on user search criteria.
 Ensure the backend code follows basic coding best practices for readability and maintainability.
Frontend Development:
 Develop a frontend application using a JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular).
 Implement a user interface that allows users to input search criteria (e.g., location, price range,
property type) and view the search results.
 Ensure the frontend code is clean and well-structured, following basic coding best practices.

Deliverables:
 The candidate is expected to provide the following deliverables within the two-day timeframe:

results.
 A backend API developed using .NET Core that handles the search functionality and returns
filtered property listings.

Evaluation Criteria:
 The candidate will be evaluated based on their ability to:

 Quickly develop a functional frontend application and backend API within the given timeframe
using .NET Core.
 Apply basic coding best practices for clean and readable code.

Note: This case study is designed to assess the candidate&#39;s ability to quickly develop a basic property
search application using .NET Core within a short timeframe. While the scope is limited, it still evaluates
their coding skills, ability to handle basic search functionality, and deliver a functional and well-designed
application.
